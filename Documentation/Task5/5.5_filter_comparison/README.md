## Advantages of analog filters 

1. fairly simple
   * analog filters don't need ADC, DAC converters or any microprocessor to work
2. no need to write a program/algorithm
3. require minimal components
   * For example a simple RC filters requires minimal analog components


## Advantages of digital filters 

1. programmable 
   * digital filters are programmable and therefore more adaptive, because we can make any changes in it without affact the filter circuitry
2. significantly easy to design, simulate and test on software programs
   * In addition to that, since digital filters are simple software, they can be easily standardized
3. are less sensitive towards environmental changes, noises and disturbances.
