# Selection criteria

* Size. Microchips and Computer Processors
* MOSFETs can be made much smaller than BJTs. Many more MOSFETs can be placed in a smaller area than BJTs. For this reason MOSFETs form the bulk of the transistors used in microchips and computer processors
* Noise. Signal Processing applications or voltage amplifiers
* MOSFETs are less noisy than BJTs. In an electronics context noise refers to random interference in a signal. When a transistor is used to amplify a signal the internal processes of the transistor will introduce some of this random interference. BJTs generally introduce more noise into the signal than MOSFETs. This means MOSFETs are more suitable for signal processing applications or for voltage amplifiers.
* Higher Power Consumption
* will consume more power because it’s wasting current when it’s switch on
